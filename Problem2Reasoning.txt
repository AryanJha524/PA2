Strategy 1:
  Pro: This strategy allows guests to do as they please regarding the rest of the party;
  they can roam around, visiting other parts of the party.
  Cons: Using this strategy, the guests (threads) have no guarantee if they will be able
  to access the vase (the shared resource). There are no protocols in place to ensure each
  guest is able to access the resource (the vase), so starvation can occur. Crowding around
  the room also prevents guests from accomplishing their other tasks (exploring the rest of
  the party)

Strategy 2:
  Pros: This strategy prevents any unnecessary crowding from occurring. Guests won't crowd
  the room when the sign reads "BUSY" and can accomplish other tasks in the meantime. Also
  each guest is responsible for setting the sign, so no external resource is required to
  manage them
  Cons: However with this strategy there is no guarantee that each guest gets to see the vase.
  For example, a guest can come to check the vase but it always reads "BUSY" since other guests
  manage to get to the vase first.

Strategy 3:
  Pros: Strategy allows for each guest to visit the vase since they are standing in a queue, which
  has a determined order to it (first in first out). This explicit ordering prevents starvation from
  occurring.
  Cons: Although each guest does get to access the resource, they are stuck in a queue and cannot roam
  around the party (accomplishing any other tasks).
